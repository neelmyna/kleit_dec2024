KLEIT SAMSUNG PYTHON TRAINING DECEMBER-2024

DAY1 MONDAY 09-12-2024

1. Create Github Account
2. Create new Repo
	1. Click on "+" on top right and Click New Repository
	2. Give repo name, keep the repo public, add the necessary description and slect the check box "add-readme file" and then click "create repository"
My Repo Link:
https://github.com/neelmyna/kleit_dec2024

3. Organising and Arranging Files and Folders in our System:
	1. Create new folder named "software" in C drive
	2. Create following folders inside "C:\software"
		git, pyhton, vs_code, notepad_pp, mingw, jdk, eclipse, mysql, postman, node etc.
	3. Download all the installer files and cut and paste them from "downloads" folder into respective folder.
	4. Now Install them one by one by using double click
	5. Add the path of the Applications to "environment variables" which we wish to use the CLI from any path of our choice.
	6. Check if the CLIs are working in the path of your choice.
	
4. Cofigure your github account on your system.
	$ git config --global user.name "neelmyna"
	$ get config --global user.email "nithinemail@gmail.com"

5. Steps to create PAT (personal access token)
	1. Click on Profile Pic (Right Top most corner) -> Click settings
	2. In new page, sroll down and bottom left corner -> Click Developer settings
	3. On Left side, Under personal access tokens -> Click down arrow -> Click tokens Classic
	4. In new window -> Click Generate new token -> Click Classic
	5. U may be prompted for password (Complete this task)
	6. Add a note: 
	7. Expiration: Select No Expiration
	8. Do no other changes and scroll down -> Click generate token
	9. Copy the PAT and mail/whatsApp to yourself 

To download a public Repo, use the below command:
$ git clone https://github.com/neelmyna/kleit_dec2024

To set the Configurations:
$ git config --global user.name "your_git_username"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email"

To update my Remote Repo, use the below 3 commands:

1. Mark the files that need to be updated (Stage the Changes)
1.
$ git add .
OR
$ git add c:\learning\python\samsung_python_training

Here, . (dot) means, current folder (directory or path)

2. Commit the staged changes (git will create the object to be sent to server)
$ git commit -m "your message"

3. Now send the changes that need to be updated in the remote repo.
Note that, the pull command is implicitly 1st run before the push.
$ git push origin main

NOTE: To keep cheking the changes, use the below command:
$ git status

Template Command to clone our Repo using PAT:
$ git clone https://PAT@github.com/neelmyna/kleit_dec2024

OPERATORS IN PYTHON:

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ - / // * % **

All are binary operators (Need 2 operands)
I/P are numbers
O/P is also a number
In the expresssion 10 + 5 - 12, addition is performed 1st.
Hence arithmetic operators have Left to Right Associtivity, except the power operator.
That is, 10 + 5 + 15 = 15 + 15 = 30
2 ** 3 ** 2 = 2 ** 9 = 512
The operator ** has the highest priority/precdence
Precedence of operators:
**
* / // %
+ -

Relational Operators:
> < >= <= != ==
All are Binary operators.
I/P are numbers
O/P is truth value (boolean)
They have lesser precedence than arithmetic operators, but higher than logical operators.

What ever we do using >= and <= can be done using > and < respectively.
For example:
age >= 20 and age <= 80
is same as:
age > 19 and age < 81

[10, 20] Closed Interval
The range includes the end values
num >= 10 and num <= 20

(30, 50) Open Interval
The range is 31 to 49 because it doesn't include the end values
num > 30 and num < 50

[20, 40) Right Open
The range is 20 to 39
num >= 20 and num < 40

A student can enroll into the course if her age is between 18 and 60
student_age >= 18 and student_age <= 60
This is more readable

student_age > 17 and student_age < 61
This is less readable
---------------------------------------------
LOGICAL OPERATORS:
and or not (Strictly Short Circuiting)

I/P are boolean
O/P is boolean
not operator is unary (We prefix the not before the value)
and or are binary operators
Left to Right Associtivity
In the expresssion: op1 and op2 or op3
op1 and op2 is performed 1st
The o/p of a condition is always passed as i/p to the logical operators.

DAY2 PROGRAMS

1. Check if a number is Even.

input_number = 454
# We have assumed 45 as the input number to the program

if input_number % 2 == 0:
    print(input_number, ' is an Even number')
------------------------------------------
2. Check if the user given number is Even or not.

print('Enter a number to check if it is Even or not')
input_number = int(input())
#print(type(input_number))

if input_number % 2 == 0:
    print(input_number, ' is an Even number')
else:
    print(f'{input_number} is not an Even number')
----------------------------------------------------
3. Check if the user given number is Even or Odd.

print('Enter a number to check if it is Even or not')
input_number = int(input())
#print(type(input_number))

#if n%2==0:
if input_number % 2 == 0:
    print(input_number, ' is an Even number')
else:
    print(f'{input_number} is an Odd number')
----------------------------------------------------
4. Check if user given year is a leap year

----------------------------------------------------
5. Check if user given number is 2 digit number

----------------------------------------------------
6. Read a string frpom the user and check if it is raining, then either go out with umbrella or play in water.

----------------------------------------------------
7. Read 2 string input from user, whether it is raining and lightning, then do not go out. If it is only raining then either go out with umbrella or play in water.
